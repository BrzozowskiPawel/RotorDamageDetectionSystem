Rotor damage detection system by using artificial intelligence.
---
This program was created on the basis of a project implemented during the sixth semester of studies in the field of automation and robotics.

Using artificial intelligence algorithms (random forrest), we are analying the current flowing through the engine that drives the drone.

Then we check whether it is possible to obtain a model that allows detecting rotor devices with satisfactory accuracy. 

In order to obtain more information about the project and the code written, please read the file "Report.pdf" (file in Polish).
